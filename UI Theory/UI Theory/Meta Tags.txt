<meta> tags
===========
Meta data is the data about the data. Our web page shows and tells some information.
But meta data tells about our web page. It is the information about the page
Some of the meta tags can be used in the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 

NOTE: meta tags wont contain a closing tag. The attributes in it tells about the tag
      It is not displayed on the page itself, it can be read by search engines and web crawlers.    

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) 
use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information. 

Ex:
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30; url = http://www.google.com">
  
  <title>Meta Data</title>
  <base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <style></style>
</head>


Attribute			Value					Description
---------			-----					-----------
charset			    character_set		Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document

content		                text			Specifies the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute

http-equiv		content-security-policy
			    content-type		Provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute
	                    default-style
		              refresh			

name		          application-name
			       author
			     description		Specifies a name for the metadata
			     generator
			     keywords
	                      viewport			

The good meta tags
==================
These are the meta tags that should be on every page, no matter what.

1. Meta content type
--------------------
This tag is necessary to declare your character set for the page
Ex:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"/>
<meta charset="UTF-8"/>

NOTE: UTF-8 - Character encoding for Unicode
      ISO-8859-1 - Character encoding for the Latin alphabet

2. Title
--------
While the title tag doesn’t start with "meta," it is in the header and contains information that's very important to SEO. 
You should always have a unique title tag on every page that describes the page.
Recommend keeping your titles under 60 characters long
(You can see the title clearly when number of pages occur in the search results)

Ex: <title>Page Title</title>

3. Meta description
-------------------
This tag doesn't influence ranking, but it's very important regardless
It provides description about the page (when number of pages occur in the search results) 
Should be within 160 characters, and write it to catch the user's attention.

Ex: <meta name="description" content="This is an example of a meta description. This will often show up in search results.">


4. Viewport
-----------
In this mobile world, you should be specifying the viewport. If you don’t, you run the risk of having a poor mobile experience

"width=device-width" instructs the page to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels.
(Some browsers keep the page's width constant when rotating to landscape mode, and zoom rather than reflow to fill the screen)
"initial-scale=1" instructs browsers to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels regardless of device orientation
(i.e) initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Ex: <meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">





The indifferent meta tags
=========================


1. Social meta tags
-------------------
OpenGraph and Twitter data are important to sharing
Ex: <meta name="twitter:site" content="@publisher_handle">


2. Robots
---------
<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />


3. Keywords 
-----------
No good SEO is going to recommend spending any time on this tag, there's some very small possibility it could help you somewhere.
Ex: <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

4. Refresh
----------
This is the poor man's redirect and should not be used, if at all possible. You should always use a server-side 301 redirect.
Ex: meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5, url=http://www.google.com" />

*5. Revised
-----------
Ex: <meta name= "revised" content="Author who revised it, 15/12/2020">


6. Language
-----------
The only reason to use this tag is if you're moving internationally and need to declare the main language used on the page.

Ex:<html lang="en">
	...
   </html>

Chinese		zh
Gujarati	gu
Hindi		hi




Bad meta tags
=============
Nothing bad will happen to your site if you use these — let me just make that clear. They're a waste of space though; even Google says so

1. author
---------

2. Revisit after
----------------

3. Rating 
---------

4. Expiration/date   
------------------
Expiration" is used to note when the page expires, and "date" is the date the page was made 

5. Copyright 
------------
Look at the footer of your site. I would guess it says "Copyright 20xx" in some form. Why say it twice

6. Generator
------------

7. Cache-control
----------------

8. Resource type
----------------




Doubts
======
In viewport why dont we set the height to follow the scree height
