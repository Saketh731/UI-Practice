CSS Vendor Prefixes
===================


What are CSS Vendor Prefixes?
=============================
Here the vendor means the Browser Vendors
We place the vendor prefixes before a CSS property name


Formats
-------
'-' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name
'_' + vendor identifier + '-' + meaningful name


Each browser has its own separate vendor identifier

Prefix			Browser(s)
------			----------
-webkit-		Google Chrome, Safari, Android Browser
-moz-			Firefox
-o-			Opera
-ms-			Internet Explorer, Edge
-khtml-			Konqueror


Ex:

.styling{
-webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
-moz-transition: all 4s ease;
-ms-transition: all 4s ease;
-o-transition: all 4s ease;
transition: all 4s ease; 
}



NOTE: Although they are typically used before the property name, 
      they can also be used to prefix specifc parts of the property value, as is shown in the exmaple below


.example {
  background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, color-stop(0%, #000), color-stop(100%, #fff));

  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #000 0%, #fff 100%);

  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #000 0%, #fff 100%);
}





Why do we use them?
===================
Before new properties are formally added to CSS, browsers have the ability to test them out using their own methods of implementation
In order to allow this differing implementation between browsers during the testing phase, the vendor-prefixing policy was introduced in CSS2.1



How do we use them?
===================
The proper way to use vendor-prefixed properties is to place them before the unprefixed property
Ex:
.example {
  -webkit-animation-name: slidein;
  -o-animation-name: slidein;
  -ms-animation-name: slidein;
  -moz-animation-name: slidein;
  animation-name: slidein;
}

By putting the unprefixed version last, we ensure that, when browsers eventually support the official property, that is what they will use





Which properties need a prefix?
===============================
The list of properties for which we need to use vendor prefixes is always changing
