Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.


What are Semantic Elements?
===========================
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

******NOTE: Elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> act more or less like <div> elements. 
	    They group other elements together into page sections. However where a <div> tag could contain any type of information, 
	    it is easy to identify what sort of information would go in a semantic <header> region.

Usage of Semantic tags?
=======================
Semantics elements in HTML can be used to define different parts of a web page:
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
<form>
<table>


<section> Element
-----------------
Defines a section in a document
A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.  Ex: Introduction, content, and contact information

NOTE: A section can have its own <header> and <footer> in it

	
<article> Element
-----------------
<article> element specifies independent, self-contained content
An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
Ex:Forum post
   Blog post
   Newspaper article


NOTE: An article can have its own <header> and <footer> in it


Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
---------------------------------------------
<section> elements can contain <article> elements, and <article> elements can contain <section> elements.


<header> Element
----------------
The <header> element is generally found at the top of a document, a section, or an article 
and usually contains the main heading and some navigation and search tools.

<header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
Ex: <header> element typically contains: one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
					 logo or icon
					 authorship information

NOTE: 	 You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. 
	 However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.



footer> Element
---------------
A <footer> is generally found at the bottom of a document, a section, or an article
Defines a footer for a document, section, article
Just like the <header> the content is generally metainformation, such as author details, legal information etc..
Note: It is also valid to include <section> elements within a footer

Ex: authorship information
    copyright information
    contact information
    sitemap
    back to top links
    related documents

NOTE: You can have several <footer> elements in one document.
  


<small> Element
---------------
The <small> element often appears within a <footer> or <aside> element which would usually 
contain copyright information or legal disclaimers, and other such fine print. 
Ex: <footer><small>&copy;Company A</small> Date</footer>



<nav> Element
-------------
<nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

NOTE: NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.



<aside> Element
---------------
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

Ex:
<head>
<style>
aside {
  width: 30%;
  padding-left: 15px;
  margin-left: 15px;
  float: right;
  font-style: italic;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<p>The Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</aside>

</body>



<figure> and <figcaption> Elements
----------------------------------
The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. 
The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.

Ex: <figure>
       <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
       <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
    </figure>









<details> Tag
-------------
Specifies additional details that the user can open and close on demand.
<details> tag is often used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close
Tip: The <summary> tag is used in conjuction with <details> to specify a visible heading for the details.

Ex:
<details>
  <summary>Epcot Center</summary>
  <p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</details>


<mark tag>
----------
Defines text that should be marked or highlighted
Ex: <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>


<time> tag
----------
The <time> element allows an unambiguous ISO 8601 date to be attached to a human-readable version of that date.
Why bother with <time>? While humans can read time that can disambiguate through context in the normal way, 
the computers can read the ISO 8601 date and see the date, time, and the time zone.

Ex: <p>Open from <time>10:00</time> to <time>21:00</time> every weekday.</p>
    <time datetime="2017-10-31T11:21:00+02:00">Tuesday, 31 October 2017</time>
    <p>I have a date on <time datetime="2008-02-14 20:00">Valentines day</time>.</p>

NOTE: The datetime attribute of this element is used translate the time into a machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add 
      date reminders through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results




Doubts
------
Why sematics tags if we can use <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> instead
Are all there <header>, <footers> must in a website, as i read they are useful for SEO and also seen websites which dont even use them  Ex: figure tag
Even header element containd a navigation links, so what is the use of <nav> tag
In which section do we placed the adds, and also I observed they are given position:sticky
These are just meaningfull names wright, any way we have to handle the layout using frameworks, float, flexbox, grid
Are sidebars for navigation purpose should be declared in <aside> tag always
