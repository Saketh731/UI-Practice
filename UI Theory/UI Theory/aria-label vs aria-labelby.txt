aria-label
==========
The aria-label attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element. 
Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen. (If there is visible text labeling the element, use aria-labelledby instead.)
[***NOTE: You should only use aria-label when it’s not possible to have the label visible on screen]

Ex: <div role="group" aria-label="Groceries">
    <img src="xyz.com" role="button" aria-label="Follow on instagram">



aria-labelledby
===============
In theory, you should use aria-labelledby if the text is visually on-screen somewhere
aria-labelledby attribute refers to the IDs of the elements that act as their labels 
(Also you need to use aria-labelby instead of aria-label when the label keeps on changing. Ex: For images)

However, with current support, you should always use aria-labelledby, even if you need the label to be hidden
because VoiceOver doesn’t correctly read the hierarchy if aria-label is in use.


Ex: 
<p id="group1">Outer group</p>
<p id="item1">First item</p>
<div role="group" aria-labelledby="group1">
<a href="javascript:" role="button" aria-labelledby="item1">Item Content</a>
</div>

VoiceOver will read the button as “First item Outer group button”


Ex2:
<p id="item1">First item</p>
<div role="group" aria-label="Outer group">
<a href="javascript:" role="button" aria-labelledby="item1">Item Content</a>
</div>

VoiceOver will now read the button as simple “First item button”
