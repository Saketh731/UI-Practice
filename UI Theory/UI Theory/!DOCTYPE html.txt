<!DOCTYPE html> - it is not a tag but a statement	
Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration	
It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML used in building the web document, so that the browser can renders it correctly(properly).
This helps the browser to handle and load it properly



doctype in Older Versions of HTML
=================================
In HTML 4.01, the DOCTYPE declaration refers to a document type definition (DTD)
A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements of an XML document
Because HTML 4.01 was based on the Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML), referring to a DTD in the DOCTYPE declaration was necessary.

Additionally, doctypes for HTML 4.01 required the declaration of either strict, transitional, or frameset DTD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Strict DTD:
	  Used for web pages that exclude attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as CSS support grows
	  Ex: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
2.Transitional DTD: 
          Used for web pages that include attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as CSS support grows
	  Ex: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
3.Frameset DTD: 
          Used for web pages with frames
	  EX: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">




HTML5 (and above) doctype Declaration
=====================================
HTML5 <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is the simplest and shortest compared to those used by previous versions
It dosen't refer to DTD	 as it is no longer based on SGML
Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>

It follows all the web standerds given by W3C 
By specifying <!DOCTYPE html> browser renderes the page in **Full standards mode**





History
=======
During the formative years of HTML, web standards were not agreed upon yet. Browser vendors would build new features in whatever way they wanted.
So web developers choose a specific browser to develop their site, This meant that sites would not render well in unsupported browsers.

The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) wrote a set of web standards to handle this situation
Now it was a trouble to browser vendor as they are having previous sites built already and cannot change them now
To handle this problem, browser vendors began programming rendering modes in to their browsers. So web developers need to add doctype declaration at the top of an HTML document
*****The doctype declaration would tell the browser which rendering mode to use for that document******

Three separate rendering modes were generally available across browsers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Full standards mode renders pages according to the W3C web standards.
2.Quirks mode renders pages in a non standards compliant way.
3.Almost standards mode is close to full standards mode, but features support for a small number of quirks.


****NOTE****
------------
If we give <!DOCTYPE html> it specifies the browser to use Full standards rendering mode 
If we dont specify any doctype the browser enters Quirks mode and tries to deal with your code as if it was written in the late 90â€™s.
